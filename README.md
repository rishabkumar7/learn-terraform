### Introduction to IaC and Terraform

What is Infrastructure as Code?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes. With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.

What is Terraform?
Terraform was developed by [Hashicorp](https://www.terraform.io/). It is a configuration orchestration tool that is incredible for provisioning, adjusting and destroying the virtual server environments. It is available both as a DevOps-as-a-Service enterprise-grade from Hashicorp and as an open-source solution, which allows you to work with a variety of Cloud Service Providers to create multi-cloud ecosystems.
